### Diffs to official Magisk

- [App] Added a new feature to install Magisk into `/system` partition for emulators that do not have a boot image. This allows users to root their emulators without modifying the kernel or the ramdisk.
- [Zygisk] Changed the method of injecting zygote process by using ptrace implementation from [ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext), it is an open source project written by [Dr-TSNG](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) and [5ec1cff](https://github.com/5ec1cff). This is more reliable and compatible with some emulators that ignore `ro.dalvik.vm.native.bridge` property.
- [General] Enhanced the support for mounting in pre-init for modules. This enables modules to modify the system before the init process starts, which can be useful for some advanced use cases.
- [General] Implemented a new feature to support deleting file by using indicated whiteout character device, similar to `overlayfs`. This allows modules to delete files from the original system without actually modifying it.
- [Zygisk] Added support for GrepheneOS Android 14, a privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility. This is because the official Magisk does not support it.
- [General] Restored support for devices with no selinux support, which was removed by the official Magisk. This allows users to use Magisk on devices that do not have selinux enabled.
